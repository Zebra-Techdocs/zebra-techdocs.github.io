* **MX 7.x -** Nougat devices
* **MX 6.x -** Marshmallow devices
* **MX 5.1/MX 5.2 -** Lollipop devices
* **MX 5.0 -** Some KitKat devices
* **MX 4.4 -** Some KitKat devices
* **MX 4.3 -** Jelly Bean devices and some older TC70 devices running KitKat that ship with the Rapid Deployment Client.

**Notes**:
* **The StageNow client is preinstalled on all devices running KitKat 4.4 and higher**. 
* **Devices with MX 6.0 and higher support staging through a Wi-Fi Hotspot**. 
* **Until changed, the selected MX version is saved for subsequent profile creation**.
