info: Some apps that require a particular orientation (e.g. DataWedge, StageNow) override this setting. The settings of this parameter are ignored on devices with physical (capacitive-touch) orientation buttons such as the EC30 and TC77. Supported only on devices running Android 10 or later. Android 11 requires MX 11.2 or later. Landscape is the default orientation on tablet devices, and the basis for other orientation references in this parameter.
