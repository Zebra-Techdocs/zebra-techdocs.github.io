Used to set the length of time the device will wait during periods of inactivity (without screen touches or key presses) before turning off the screen to conserve power. Ideally, this interval should represent a balance between battery preservation and user convenience.

>**Note:** Android supports only the display-screen timeout settings shown in the table below. Specifying a value between any two supported values will change the setting to the closest supported value. Specifying a value outside the minimum or maximum shown will cause an error in the Result XML document and the setting change will be ignored.
