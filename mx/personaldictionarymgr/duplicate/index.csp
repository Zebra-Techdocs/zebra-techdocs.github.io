Determines whether to allow duplicate terms to be appended to the Personal Dictionary when using the "Add words from a file" parameter. When this box is checked (value=1), all terms in the specified file are appended to the Personal Dictionary without regard to duplication. When unchecked (value=0), duplicate terms are deleted from the dictionary and added from the file. 

**<u>Duplicate checking is case sensitive</u>**. This allows certain abbreviations to exist along with their common language equivalents. For example, the abbreviation "AD" has many uses in the medical profession, while its lower-case equivalent "ad" is commonly used to refer to an advertisement. However, this attribute over time could result in a dictionary containing duplicates of equivalent terms. For example, "Crohn's disease" and "Crohn's Disease" (upper-case "D") are like terms, but are treated as different by the duplication-checking function.
