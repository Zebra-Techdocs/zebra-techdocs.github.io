Used to enter a specific locale on which to perform an Action, such as Add Word. A locale is the combination of a language and a region in which that language is spoken. Languages are identified by two lower-case letters; regions are identified by two upper-case letters. The locale joins the two letter-pairs with an underscore ("_") character. For example, "en_US" is the locale specification for "English spoken in the United States," and "fr_CA" is the locale specification for "French spoken in Canada." 

For a list of supported locales, see the [UI Manager](../uimgr/#set-current-locale).
