This is the On/Off switch for Zebra Bug Reporting on the device. When enabled (option 2), Zebra Bug Reporting is used to generate, store and transport bug reports and to supplement reports with information provided by the device user, if desired. When this parameter is disabled (option 1), the device uses Android bug reporting functionality.
