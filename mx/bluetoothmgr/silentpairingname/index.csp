Used to specify the name of a Bluetooth device with which to allow device pairing without requiring user confirmation. **Only the Name field is required to create a Silent Pairing Rule**. Optionally, device Name can be combined with Class of Device and/or Upper Address Part (UAP) of the device's MAC address to create Silent Pairing Rules with more specificity than using the device Name alone. 

**Input value rules**:
