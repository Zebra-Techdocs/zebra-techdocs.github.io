Used to designate channels in the 5GHz band for use by the device. While channels used in this band are generally determined automatically through negotiation with the Wi-Fi infrastructure, channels or sets of channels also can be specified manually to avoid interference with other devices or to dedicate certain channels for specific purposes. **Warning: Not all channels are available in all countries**. See the [List of WLAN Channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels) for more information.

**Parm value input rules**: 

* String from 0-64 characters containing a set of valid channels
* Multiple values must be separated by commas (i.e. "7,11,12,16...")
* Also accepts ranges when specified with a hyphen (-) (i.e. "36-60")
