Used to specify the type of encryption key to be used by the network. A key is specified only when the Security Mode is "Personal" since the "Open" Security Mode does not use encryption and the "Enterprise" Security Mode distributes keys automatically after Authentication.

An encryption key can be specified using either of these methods: 

* A hexadecimal value (the key itself)
* A passphrase used to generate a key using a pre-defined algorithm

The selected method usually depends on the configuration of the Wi-Fi network because the key must be shared between the Wi-Fi infrastructure and the client. Therefore, they must use a common method to specify the key.
