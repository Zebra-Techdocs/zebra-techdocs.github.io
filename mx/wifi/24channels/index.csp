Used to designate channels in the 2.4GHz band for use by the device. While channels used in this band are generally determined automatically through negotiation with the Wi-Fi infrastructure, channels or sets of channels also may be specified manually to avoid interference with other devices or to dedicate certain channels to specific purposes. **Warning: Not all channels are available in all countries**. See the [List of WLAN Channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels) for more information.

**Parm value input rules**: 

* String from 0-64 characters containing a set of valid channels
* Multiple values must be separated by commas (i.e. "1,6,11,14")
* Also accepts ranges when specified with a hyphen (-) (i.e. "1,7-10")
