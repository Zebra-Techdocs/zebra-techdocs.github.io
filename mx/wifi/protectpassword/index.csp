Controls whether passwords will be stored as encrypted or clear text while in transit to the device. Passwords specified in Profile Manager are embedded within an XML file and sent to the device for consumption as part of a configuration. Encrypting a Password using this parameter might be desirable as a security measure to prevent extraction and exploitation in case the XML is intercepted while in transit. 

Passwords are stored in clear text on the device unless specifically encrypted using the Protect Password Encryption parameter. Encrypted and clear-text Passwords are stored in a protected area on the device that is inaccessible to users and unauthorized applications. 

The Password combines with an Identity to form an authentication credential for gaining access to a network. Authentication is required only when "Enterprise" is the selected Security Mode. All authentication types require a Password except EAP-TLS, which uses a client certificate.
