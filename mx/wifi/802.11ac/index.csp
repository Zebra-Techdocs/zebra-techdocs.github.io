This is the On/Off switch for 802.11ac wireless protocol on the device, which operates on the 5GHz band and provides faster transfer rates than 802.11n and other earlier protocols. **Requires network infrastructure that explicitly supports the 802.11ac protocol**. 

> **Note**: Enabling 802.11ac also enables the 802.11n protocol on the device.
