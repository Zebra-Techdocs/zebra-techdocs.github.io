This is the On-Off switch for the Wi-Fi radio. **Note: Wi-Fi must be enabled to change certain other Wi-Fi settings**, including those controlled by the Network Actions parameter described later in this document. Attempting to change such settings while the Wi-Fi radio is disabled will return an error in the Result XML. **Zebra recommends beginning any profile created to change Wi-Fi settings with a command to Enable the Wi-Fi radio**. 

**Caution**: Some Wi-Fi parameters vary from conventions used by other CSPs: 
* The "Enable" and "Disable" settings in the Wi-Fi CSP control whether a user or administrator can "turn on" and "turn off" a feature or capability, or to set its state as "active" or "inactive." Such terms in other CSPs refer to the feature's "Usage" setting, which can prevent access to the feature entirely.
* The value "0" is used in Wi-Fi parameters to "Disable" a feature, select its default setting or "make no change" or "do nothing" to a setting. In most other CSPs, the "0" value is used to select the "make no change" option.
