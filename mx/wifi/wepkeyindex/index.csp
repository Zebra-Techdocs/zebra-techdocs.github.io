Some Wi-Fi infrastructure that implements a network using WEP encryption may support multiple WEP keys and a WEP index to indicate which key to use at any given time. 

> **Note:** Android does not currently support multiple WEP keys per network. Therefore, only the first WEP key (`wep[0]`) is supported.
