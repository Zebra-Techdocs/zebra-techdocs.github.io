        <p>The Notification Manager (NotificationMgr) allows an administrator to control which apps on the device are allowed to display notifications and which should have their messages automatically dismissed by the system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Show all notifications </li>

<li>Hide all notifications</li>

<li>Select individual app(s) from which to show/hide notifications</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> <strong>SECURITY WARNING: Notification Manager does not suppress app notifications when its "Hide" option is selected</strong>. Instead, messages from apps selected to be "hidden" are automatically dismissed. It is therefore possible for a device user to view messages briefly before they're dismissed by the system. </p>
