Once granted, permission is retained by the app unless explicitly revoked by a subsequent Permission Action, app is uninstalled by any means or an Enterprise Reset or Factory Reset is performed. If an app loses permission through uninstallation, permission can be re-granted only after the app is reinstalled. </p>
