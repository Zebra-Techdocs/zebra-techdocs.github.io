Controls whether a limit can be placed on cellular data usage on the device. When Enabled, the device user or an app running on the device can access other parameters that turn data limiting on and off and that control the limit value (in MB per month) and the warning message displayed when the limit is reached. **If this parameter is Disabled and cellular data is Enabled on the device, there will be no means of limiting data usage over the cellular network, and all related parameters will be inaccessible by apps or the device user**.
