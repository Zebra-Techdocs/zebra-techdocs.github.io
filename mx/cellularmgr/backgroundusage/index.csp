Used to control whether the device user has access to the Background Data option on the device. When Disabled, Background Data cannot be turned on or off programmatically or by the device user.

The Background Data Option determines whether applications that are not in the foreground should be permitted to maintain a data connection over the cellular network (if they are capable of doing so). For example, some email applications continue to download messages while other apps are active or when the device's screen is turned off. **The convenience of having data ready "when it's asked for" must be considered when planning for cellular bandwidth utilization and weighed against the potential for data overage and roaming costs**.
