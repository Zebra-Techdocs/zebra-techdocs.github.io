Controls whether the cellular connection on the device can be used to transmit data. When Enabled, the state (active/inactive) of the cellular data connection can be controlled programmatically or by the user. When Disabled, the device is prevented from establishing a data connection using the cellular network and the state cannot be changed. **This parameter controls only cellular _data_; voice and SMS messaging apps are uneffected by this setting**.
