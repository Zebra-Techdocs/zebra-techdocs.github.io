The tab bar will be visible at all times except when next-word suggestions (if enabled) are being displayed. "Keys" mode permits keys to be used to switch layouts. Such keys are typically in the lower-left corner of the layout and are subject to restrictions listed below.

* The tab bar will not appear if the Next Word Suggestions bar _**and**_ the Voice Input Key are both disabled.

* If the `TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS` input type is enabled, neither the tab bar nor the suggestion bar will appear. [About Android input types](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/InputType.html).
