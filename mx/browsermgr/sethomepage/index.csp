Used to set the Default Home Page in the form of a Universal Resource Locator (URL) for the default Android web browser on the device. Each time the default browser is opened without a URL explicitly requested by the user, it will use the URL provided by this parameter. Should be a full, valid URL (including the protocol) such as "**http://**www.google.com" corresponding to the desired default web page. This could be used to launch a specific web-based application or to direct users to an internal company web site or portal as a starting point for browsing. Specifying an empty (length of zero) value or the absence of this parm from the XML will cause no change; any previously specified Default Home Page will be retained.

**Parm value input rules**: 

* String from 0-2000 characters
