<p><strong>In preparation for Google-mandated security restrictions being phased in starting with devices running Android 11</strong>, Zebra has implemented <a href="/ssm">Secure Storage Manager (SSM)</a>, a mechanism for securely sharing files and/or data from an originating app with one or more target apps in compliance with Android security mandates. <strong>SSM is preinstalled on all Zebra devices running Android 11 and later</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>SSM is compatible with the File Manger CSP delivered with MX 11.3</strong> (and later) and was designed to be completely transparent to the administrator in many file- and/or data-sharing scenarios. In some cases, minor updates are required to apps designated as the recipient of files and/or data shared through SSM. Such changes would be required not specifically for working with Zebra devices, but for compliance with Android security mandates (and will eventually be required of all Android devices).</p>
