This is the On/Off switch for folder monitoring. This Extra Scan Folders feature monitors one or more folders on the device (including those in Android-protected areas) as specified in the Extra Scan Folders List parameter. When a change within a monitored folder occurs, ThreatMgr broadcasts an Intent with the folder name and one of the [Android FileObserver constants](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/FileObserver.html#constants) to describe the event. 

**This parameter does not detect Threats**.
