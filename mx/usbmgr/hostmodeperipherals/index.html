        <p>Controls whether to allow all USB peripherals to be used when the device is in USB Host Mode or to restrict usage to peripherals as defined in Rules created by the administrator using the <a href="#control-rules">Control Rules</a> parameter. Allowed USB peripherals connect "silently" to the device, displaying no pop-up message to the user upon connection. Optionally, such rules also can permit an app to launch on connection and/or grant an app permission to access the peripheral. </p>
