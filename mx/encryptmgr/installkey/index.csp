Used to choose whether to Add a Named Key to the Key Storage Database on the device. Adding a Named Key to the Key Storage Database on the device makes a key available for use when activating Full Storage Card Encryption or when creating EFSes.

**Notes**: 

* Only one Encrypted File System (EFS) can be mounted at a time using a given mount point. 
* Attempts to create an EFS with a mount point that is already in use by a mounted EFS will result in creation of a new EFS that will not be mounted. 
* Named keys added to the Key Storage Database can impact storage cards or EFSes previously encrypted using that key. 
* Storage that became inaccessible by removing its key will become accessibe and could be re-mounted when a key of the same name and value is added.
