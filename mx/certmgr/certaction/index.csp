Used to Install or Uninstall a certificate or to initialize the Android Keystore. If a certificate is installed with the same alias as one that already exists in the Keystore, the existing certificate is overwritten by the new one.

**Note: The Android Keystore can be "initialized" only once; subsequent uses of the Initialize Android Keystore function will simply reset the password, leaving the Keystore intact**. To return the Android Keystore to a pre-initialized state, see the Enterprise Reset and Factory Reset functions of [Power Manager](../powermgr).
