This parm allows you to specify whether or not the device user will be allowed to change any Wi-Fi configuration from the "Wi-Fi" section of the System Settings Menu and the Quick Settings.

>**Note:** While the title of this parm might make it seem that it only controls whether the device user is allowed to Turn Wi-Fi On or Off, it actually controls whether any changes to Wi-Fi configuration can be made. There is no way to control the ability to Turn Wi-Fi On and Off independently of other Wi-Fi configuration.
