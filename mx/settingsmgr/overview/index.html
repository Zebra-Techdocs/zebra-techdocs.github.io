        <p>The Settings Manager (SettingsMgr) controls access to specific device capabilities in the Android System Settings panel. This allows administrators to prevent device users from changing settings that are sensitive in nature or could lead to undesired results. See <a href="../../.././mx/accessmgr">AccessMgr</a> for other Settings panel feature restrictions. Use <a href="../../../../mx/appmgr">AppMgr</a> to prevent access to the Settings panel entirely. </p>

<p><strong>Note: Settings Manager controls only <em>access</em> to settings in the Android Settings panel; <em>it does not control the settings themselves</em></strong>. For example, if Wi-Fi is disabled on a device (through the <a href="/mx/wifi">Wi-Fi Manager CSP</a>), using Settings Manager to disable access to Wi-Fi settings prevents a user from turning Wi-Fi on. Conversely, if Wi-Fi is <em>enabled</em> on a device, using Settings Manager to block access to its settings prevents a user from turning it off or changing any of its configuration settings. </p>
