Enabling this parameter (option 1) adds as wake-up sources the push-to-talk (PTT) button (on the left side of the device), scan buttons and any other button listed in the "Wake-up Sources" page in the device Settings panel (varies by device). <strong>To control individual buttons, see the Wake-up Individual Action parameter (not supported on TC20/TC25 devices</strong>).</p>
