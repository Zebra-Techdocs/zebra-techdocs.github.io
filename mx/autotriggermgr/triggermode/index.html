        <p>Controls the trigger mode of the device, and whether automatic functions are invoked. For example, the "Auto On" parameter can be used to automatically activate automatic scanning when the device is placed in a shopping cart, holster or other designated location. When trigger Mode is set to Auto On or Always On (options 1 or 2), the scanner is activated automatically whenever a scan target is detected by the proximity sensor. When trigger Mode is set to Off (option 0, <strong>the default</strong>), all scanning requires manual triggering by the device user. </p>
