<p>DataWedge supports the importation of Config files (<code>datawedge.db</code>) and Profiles (<code>dwprofile_profilename.db</code>) to devices delivered through commercially available Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) systems. When DataWedge launches, it checks the <code>/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport</code> folder for the presence of such files. If any are found, it executes the following functions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Import the new file(s)</li>

<li>Replace the existing Config file and like-named Profile(s), if any</li>

<li>Delete the imported files</li>

<li>Put new settings immediately into effect</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>For the best users experience, <strong>Zebra strongly recommends that device users be advised to <u>exit any DataWedge configuration UI screen</u></strong> before new Config files are remotely deployed.</li>

<li><strong>DataWedge versions prior to 6.9</strong> attempt to consume any of the monitored “<code>.db</code>” files as soon the file name(s) appear in the <code>/autoimport</code> folder. Therefore, <strong>it is possible for DataWedge to attempt to consume a file before it is completely written</strong>. To avoid this condition, <strong>Zebra recommends initially storing the file with an alternate extension</strong> (i.e. "<code>.tmp</code>") and changing the extension to <code>.db</code> once writing is complete.</li>

<li><strong>Zebra recommends applying explicit file permissions to all <code>.db</code> files</strong> so that DataWedge file procedures are not impeded.</li>
</ul>

* **On devices running Android KitKat or later**, the `/enterprise` folder cannot be seen with File Explorer or other user-level tools. Moving configuration files to and from the `/autoimport` or `/enterprisereset` folders must be done programmatically, or with a staging client app or EMM. -->
