        <p>Used to enter the name of a file on the device containing configuration settings to import into DataWedge. </p>

<p><strong>Input value rules</strong>: </p>

</ul>

<p>DataWedge supports the importation of Config files (<code>datawedge.db</code>) and Profiles (<code>dwprofile_profilename.db</code>) to devices delivered through commercially available Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) systems. </p>

<p><strong>Zebra recommends copying any configuration files to the</strong> <code>/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport</code> <strong>folder <em>prior</em> to calling DataWedgeMgr</strong> with the configuration file and path. When DataWedge launches, it checks this folder and executes the following functions if files are present:</p>

<ol>
<li>Import the new file(s)</li>

<li>Replace the existing Config file and like-named Profile(s), if any</li>

<li>Delete the imported files</li>

<li>Put new settings immediately into effect</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>For the best user experience, <strong>Zebra strongly recommends that device users be advised to <u>exit any DataWedge configuration UI screen</u></strong> before new Config files are remotely deployed.</li>

<li><strong>Zebra recommends applying explicit file permissions to all <code>.db</code> files</strong> so that DataWedge file procedures are not impeded.</li>
</ul>

* **On devices running Android KitKat or later**, the `/enterprise` folder cannot be seen with File Explorer or other user-level tools. Moving configuration files to and from the `/autoimport` or `/enterprisereset` folders must be done programmatically, or with a staging client app or EMM. 

3/26/20- removed per eng: 
* **DataWedge versions prior to 6.9** attempt to consume any of the monitored “`.db`” files as soon the file name(s) appear in the `/autoimport` folder. Therefore, **it is possible for DataWedge to attempt to consume a file before it is completely written**. To avoid this condition, **Zebra recommends initially storing the file with an alternate extension** (i.e. "`.tmp`") and changing the extension to `.db` once writing is complete.
