Controls whether a request for a Boot File name will be sent by the DHCP Client to the DHCP Server in the DHCP Request. When requested, the DHCP Server will return the Boot File name to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.

A Boot File is a file that is typically used to configure a device when it first joins a network. A common usage scenario is to pull a Boot File of a given name from a TFTP Server and then use that Boot File to configure the device.

>**Note:** The DHCP Client does not automatically use the Boot File name to perform any file transfers or configuration. To configure a device, a Boot File name and a TFTP Server Name would both be need to be acquired using the DhcpOptionMgr and then provided to a TFTP Client that could perform the transfer of the Boot File and then perform any desired configuration using that file.
