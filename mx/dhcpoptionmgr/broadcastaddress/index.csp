The Broadcast Address for a network is the IP Address for which all devices on that network are enabled to receive messages. A message sent to the Broadcast Address for a network can therefore be received by all devices on that network, rather than a specific device.

This parm allows you to control whether a request for the Broadcast Address will be sent by the DHCP Client to the DHCP Server in the DHCP Request. When requested, the DHCP Server will return the Broadcast Address for the network to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.
