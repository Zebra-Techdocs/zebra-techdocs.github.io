Used to specify the name to be assigned to a Request XML document when it is made Persistent and/or to identify a currently existing Persistent Request XML document on which to perform a Persist Action. When identifying an existing Persistent Request XML document, this value is used in conjunction with the values of "Persist As Version" and "Persist As Order" (if previously specified). **Failure to submit exact values will cause no action and return an error in the Result XML**.

The value specified in Persist As Name can be used only once on the device at a given time. If a document is specified with a Persist As Name that already exists on the device, the existing document will be overwritten by the newer one. See the [List Persistent documents](#listpersistentdocuments) section of the Overview above for example Persist As Name usage.
