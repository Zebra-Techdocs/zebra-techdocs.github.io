The HostsMgr allows the device to be assigned a Host Name by which the device can be identified by admins, applications and other devices on local and DNS-enabled IP networks. The Host Name binds the device's friendly name (i.e. “MyDevice”) to its IP address so that its friendly name can be used interchangeably with its "unfriendly" IP address. A friendly name can be registered with a DNS Server (if one is present on a given network) when the device joins that network, thereby allowing other stations on the network to more easily identify other devices present on the network.

### Main Functionality

* Can Set and display the device Host Name as a string between 0 and 255 characters
