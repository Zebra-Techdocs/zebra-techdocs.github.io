The AudioVolUIMgr can add, delete and replace Audio Profiles, and can select the current Audio Profile that will be in effect on the device. It also allows you to modify the "Factory Preset" Audio Profile (which cannot be deleted), and to directly control the Mute and Vibrate states of the device, which are independent of all Audio Streams and Audio Profiles.

Many Zebra Android devices contains a Zebra Audio Volume Control UI (ZVC) that allows a device user to adjust the volumes of various Audio Streams in the device. An Audio Stream is a channel via which audio can generated and physically output (e.g. to a speaker, headset, etc.). The number of Audio Streams that can be supported by an Android device is generally fixed. But the number of possible purposes for which audio could be generated is theoretically unlimited. As a result, a particular Audio Stream might be used for a purpose other than that for which that Audio Stream is normally used in Android or a given Audio Stream might need to be used for multiple purposes.

The standard Android Audio Volume Control UI identifies each Audio Stream that can be controlled in a fixed manner that is predefined for each Audio Stream. Such identification might or might not accurately reflect the actual purposes for which a given Audio Stream is being used. This can produce a less than optimal user experience since the device user might change the volume of an Audio Stream without realizing what it might affect.

The ZVC allows configuration of the manner in which Audio Streams are identified to the device user, thus allowing the user experience to be customized. The ZVC also provides even more control over the user experience by allowing configuration of the minimum, maximum, and preset values for a given Audio Stream. For example, the minimum volume for an Audio Stream could be set greater than zero to prevent a device user from turning it off completely and potentially missing important audio notifications that are performed on that Audio Stream.

The ZVC also provides support for Audio Profiles which define different scenarios or use cases in which one or more Audio Streams can be used. Each Audio Profile can configure the behavior of ZVC for some or all of the available Audio Streams. By selecting a defined Audio Profile, the configuration of ZVC for multiple Audio Streams can be configured in a single operation. For example, there might be one Audio Profile for working in a quiet office and another for working in a noisy warehouse.

The ZVC can be invoked by a device user by pressing the physical volume control buttons on a device (when available) or by selecting the Sound->Volumes screen from the Android System Settings Menu. The UI presented by the ZVC when it is invoked by the device user will be determined based on the most recent configuration applied to ZVC using the AudioVolUIMgr, in particular the set of defined Audio Profiles and the currently selected Audio Profile. 


The following Audio Streams are supported:

* STREAM_MUSIC - The Android audio stream typically used for music playback.
* STREAM_RING - The Android audio stream typically used for the incoming call notification.
* STREAM_NOTIFICATION - The Android audio stream typically used for other notifications.
* STREAM_SYSTEM - The Android audio stream for typically used by system sounds.
* STREAM_ALARM - The Android audio stream typically used for alarms.
* STREAM_VOICE_CALL - The Android audio stream typically used for phone calls.
* Decode Beep Virtual Volume Scale - This is a special stream used on Zebra devices to produce an audible notification for barcode scanning.

An Audio Profile can be defined to configure the following settings for any or all of the above Audio Streams:

* Label - The text label. This will be displayed by the ZVC to visually identify the Audio Stream to the device user.
* Icon - The graphical icon. This will be displayed by the ZVC to visually identify the Audio Stream to the device user.
* Visibility - This will control whether the ZVC will allow the device user to view and modify the volume settings for the Audio Stream. For example, this could be used to prevent a device user from making any changes to the volume of the Audio Stream used for incoming call notification.

An Audio Profile can also configure the volume levels for each of four audio modes: Speaker, Receiver, Wired headset, and Bluetooth headset. The specified modes are determined based on the physical output path to which an Audio Stream is directed. For each mode, the following volume levels can be specified.

* Minimum volume level - This will cause the ZVC to prevent a device user from changing the volume of the Audio Stream to a value that is below the specified value. For example, this could be used to prevent the user from setting the Audio Stream used for notifications too low in noisy environments.
* Maximum volume level - This will cause the ZVC to prevent a device user from changing the volume of the Audio Stream to a value that is above the specified value. For example, this could be used to prevent the user from setting the Audio Stream used for music playback too high in quiet environments.
* Preset volume level - This will cause the ZVC to set the volume of the Audio Stream to the specified value when this Audio Profile becomes selected as the current Audio Profile.

>**Note:** The ZVC is only available on selected Zebra Android devices running the Kit Kat version of Android, as listed in the Feature Compatibility table.  Since the AudioVolUIMgr configures the ZVC, it is only supported on Zebra Android devices that include the ZVC.
