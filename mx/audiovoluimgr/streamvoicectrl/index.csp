This parm allows you to control whether the ZVC allow the device user to view and modify the volume settings for the Audio Stream that is typically used for phone calls. Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause no change to this Audio Stream's visibility. 

Parm value input rules: 

* String that has a minimum size of 0 character and a maximum size of 255 characters
* The value that is entered must be either "1", which will make the stream visible, or "0", which will make the Audio Stream hidden.
