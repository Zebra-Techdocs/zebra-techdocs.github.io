Used to specify a Password that to authenticate on the APN being added. The value is generally obtained from the GPRS carrier that provides the APN (for example, "CINGULAR1" is the password commonly used by AT&T to authenticate on its APNs). This is relevant only when the value chosen for GPRS Carrier was "Custom" since otherwise the APN values for the predefined APN will be provided automatically based on the selected GPRS carrier.

>**Note:** If an empty (length of 0) value is specified, no Password will be used. This should generally be done only if the GPRS carrier indicates that authentication with a password is not required for a given APN.
