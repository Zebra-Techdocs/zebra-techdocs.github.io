Controls whether to present the Bluetooth Pairing Popup during a pairing operation. The Bluetooth Pairing Popup is of most use when the device user will be left in charge of pairing of Bluetooth peripheral devices with an Android device. If one or more applications are expected to completely control all pairings of Bluetooth peripheral devices, the Bluetooth Pairing Popup may be seen as an unnecessary and confusing intrusion on the device user and/or as introducing the potential for the device user to mistakenly interfere with the pairing process.
