        <p>This is the On/Off switch for Split Screen functionality on the device, which allows two apps (that support the feature) to be usable at the same time, each with its own section of the screen. When enabled, Split Screen mode is accessed on some devices by long-pressing the "Recent Apps" button. <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> <strong>The StageNow client app does NOT support split-screen mode</strong>.  </p>
