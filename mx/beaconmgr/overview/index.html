        <p>Beacon Manager (BeaconMgr) controls the signal transmitted by the secondary Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio of supported devices when powered-off. This beacon can be detected by an app on a device and used as a means of locating other devices. <strong>Beacon Manager facilitates administrative control over beacon contents and settings</strong>, such as transmission power and interval, which can help balance battery consumption with detectable range. </p>

<p>One solution that leverages beaconing technology is <a href="https://techdocs.zebra.com/devicetracker">Zebra Device Tracker</a>, an Android utility that can help locate misplaced devices by honing in on their BLE beacons.</p>
