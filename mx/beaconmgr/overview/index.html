        <p>Beacon Manager (BeaconMgr) controls the signal transmitted by the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio of a powered-off device to help locate the device using <a href="#zebradevicetracker">Zebra Device Tracker</a> software running on a second device, which detects the non-connectible advertising packets sent by the device being tracked. </p>

<p>Beacon Manager provides administrative control of beacon contents as well as the interval and power level of the transmitted signal to help balance power consumption with detectable range. </p>
